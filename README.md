# Image-Hosting-API
Django API to resize images based on user account privileges


This project is still under maintenance.
Resize functionality doesn't have correct resizing to match required pixels per different account plans.
It yet doesn't have Enterprise account ability to fetch a link for previously uploaded image that expires after 
a number of seconds(expiration needs to be defined in Django models).
Docker-compose file needs to be added
